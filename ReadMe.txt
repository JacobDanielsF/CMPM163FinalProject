CMPM 163 Final Project
Ambient Occlusion and other effects
Team Psyko Jr.

How to navigate our project:

When running the executable unity file, you will come across a desert scene. Use WASD or arrow keys to move around the scene. You can also rotate the camera by clicking the screen with the left mouse button. Certain particle effects in the scene will react to the background music, so it is better to view the scene with audio enabled.
