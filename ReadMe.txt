How to navigate our project:

Download and unzip Default_Build_Windows.zip or Default_Build_MacOS.zip depending on the type of computer you are using.

When running the executable unity file, you will come across a desert scene. Use WASD or arrow keys to move around the scene. You can also rotate the camera by clicking the screen with the left mouse button. Certain particle effects in the scene will react to the background music, so it is better to view the scene with audio enabled.

Our full Unity project is contained within Final_Project_Source_Files.zip.
Addtionally, our presentation slides are included in CMPM163 Presentation.pptx.
